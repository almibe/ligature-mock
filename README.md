# ligature-mock
A painfully simple (yet working) implementation of [Ligature](https://github.com/almibe/ligature).

## Status
This project isn't used anymore.
See https://github.com/almibe/ligature or
https://github.com/almibe/ligature-jvm for updated projects.

## Goals
 * Correctness - this project should pass all tests and should probably be the first project to pass all newly added tests
 * Simplicity - this project should be easy to understand so that the more complex implementations can reference it

## Non-Goals
 * Performance - there's a lot of clones used for the sake of simplicity
 * Persistence - this is in memory only

# ligature-mock
A painfully simple (yet working) mock implementation of Ligature.

## Building
This project requires SBT to be installed.
On Linux/Mac I recommend using https://sdkman.io/ to manage SBT installs.
Once that is set up use `sbt test` to run tests `sbt publishLocal` to install the artifact locally.
